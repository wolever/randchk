* Make the walker, err, random
* Print a summary of errors at the end of the run
* Cache the last N debug statements, then print them if there is an error
* Only compare files when their mtime is <= (ie, don't check files which are
  newer on the canonical - they will most likely be different)
* Clean up the error handling, especially in listdir
